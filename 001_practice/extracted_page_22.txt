citizen Under Section 4 of Act, 1955 by seeking 
citizenship by descent soon after her birth or even by

No. 1 the provision for issue  of OCI cards was 
statutorily recognised and under the notification the 
right to education was also provided, the need for 
parents of Petitioner No. 1 to make a choice to acquire
