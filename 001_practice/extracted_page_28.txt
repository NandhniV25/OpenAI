29. It is also pertinent to refer here the judgment of the Supreme 
Court in the case of Manish Kumar v. Union of India (UOI) and Ors., 
MANU/SC/0029/2 021, with regard to the scope and a mbit of a saving 
clause in a given statute , wherein , in paragraph 298, it has been held as 
under: - 
298. While on the ambit of the saving Clause we may notice 
Bansidhar v. State of Rajasthan MANU/SC/0057/1989 : (1989) 
2 SC C 557 while dealing with the fact of saving Clause in a 
repealing statute the court held as follows : 
28. A saving provision in a repealing statute is not 
exhaustive of the rights and obligations so saved or the 
rights that survive the repeal . It is observe d by this Court 
in IT Commissioner v. Shah Sadiq & Sons 
[MANU/SC/0351/1987 : (1987) 3 SCC 516 : 1987 SCC 
(Tax) 270 : AIR 1987 SC 1217, 1221]: (SCC p. 524, para 
15) 
... In other words whatever rights are expressly saved 
by the 'savings' provision stand save d. But, that does 
not mean that rights which are not saved by the 
'savings' provision are extinguished or stand ipso facto 
terminated by the mere fact that a new statute 
repealing the old statute is enacted.  Rights which have 
accrued are saved unless they are taken away 
expressly. This is the principle behind Section 6(c), 
General Clauses Act, 1897....  
We agree with the High Court that the scheme of the 1973 Act 
does not manifest an intention contrary to, and inconsistent 
with, the saving of the repealed pr ovisions of Section 5(6 -A) 
and Chapter III -B of "1955 Act" so far as pending cases are 
concerned and that the rights accrued and liabilities incurred 
under the old law are not effaced. Appellant's contention (a) is, 
in our opinion, insubstantial.
