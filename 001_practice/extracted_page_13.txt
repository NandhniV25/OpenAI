 selection is not only over but has also been communicated  to the 
petitioner .  She qualified  her submission by stating that the recruitment 
process under question was successfully conducted in October, 2008 
i.e., at the time when the Rules of 2001 were in vogue. Moreover, t he 
petitioner has been denied the issuance of joining letter on the ground 
that the eligibility criteria had changed in the subsequent Rules  of 2010,  
which according to her ca nnot apply to the recruitment process in 
respect of which , advertisement was already issued and the entire 
recruitment process has been held and completed .  She further 
submit ted that there cannot be a dispute that the Recruitment Rules are 
always prospect ive unless specified to the contrary.   In fact, the revision 
in new Recruitment Rules i.e., the Rules of 2010  came into effect after 
the completion of recruitment process in which the petitioner was 
successful.  It is thus clear that the selection process was to be regulated 
by the then existing Recruitment Rules i.e., the Rules of 2001 and any 
amendment to the Recruitment Rules pending the issuance of joining 
letter would not affect the validity of selection already made.  She also 
submitted that 6th CPC  had not recommended the abolition of Group 
„D‟ posts, rather the recommendation was that the Group „D‟ posts be 
merged / upgraded along with Group „C‟ posts on the same pay scale.

from above , the case of the petitioner  is that his case is gov erned by the 
old Rules of 2001 and the same stand s superseded by the new Rules of 
2010 .  We note from the new Rules of 2010 i.e., Border Security Force 
Constable (Tradesman) Group „C‟ Posts Recruitment Rul es, 2010, 
itself , that it is the Rules of 2000, i.e., Border Security Force
