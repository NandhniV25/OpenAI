30. Similarly in the case of Thyssen Stahlunion Gmbh v. Steel 
Authority of India Ltd., MANU/SC/0652/1999 , specifically in 
paragraph 32, it has been held as under:   
â€œ32. Reference may yet be made to two more decisions of 
this Co urt on the question of effect of repeal of an 
enactment and as to what is right accrued. In Gajraj Singh 
and Ors. v. State Transport Appellate Trib unal and Ors. 
MANU/SC/0116/1997 :AIR1997SC412 this Court was 
examining the provisions of Section 217(1) and (2 )(a) & (b) 
and (4) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, which contained 
repeal and saving provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 
1939. The Court examined various judgments of this Court 
and Treatises on the rules of interpretation and said:  
 
22. Whenever an Act  is repealed it must be 
considered, except as to transactions past and 
closed, as if it had never existed. The effect thereof 
is to obliterate the Act completely from the record 
of Parliament as if it had never been passed; it 
never existed except for the purpose of those 
actions which were commenced, prosecuted and 
concluded while it was an existing law.  Legal 
fiction is one which is not an actual reality and 
which the law recognises and the court accepts as 
a reality.  Therefore, in case of legal fiction t he 
court believes something to exist which in reality 
does not exist . It is nothing but a presumption of 
the existence of the state of affairs which in 
actuality is non -existent. The effect of such a legal 
fiction is that a position which otherwise would n ot 
obtain is deemed to obtain under the 
circumstances . 
 
On the question on the right acquired or accrued the Court
