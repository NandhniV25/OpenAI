 petitioner to the post concerned herein have acted in an arbitrary 
manner.  Hence, the said judgment shall also not help the case of the 
petitioner.   
36. We are conscious that it is a settled position of law  that even 
candidates selec ted for appointment have no right to appointment and it

Supreme Court in the case of Jai Singh Dalal and Ot hers v. State of 
Haryana and Others, 1993 Supp (2) SCC 600,  which has also been 
relied upon by Mr. Vohra.    
37. In the said case, the selection process concerned therein had not 
been completed and before it could be completed, the State 
Government reviewed its  earlier decision and decided to revise the 
eligibility criteria for appointment and in such circumstances, it was 
held that the petitioners therein had no right to claim that the selection 
process once started must be completed.  In the present case, as a lready 
noted above, the petitioner has already been selected as his name fin ds 
mentioned in the merit list.  The only step left in the recruitment 
process was the issuance of the joining letter to the petitioner.  
Therefore, apart from our finding on the l egitimate expectation of the 
petitioner, the said judgment of the Supreme Court is also

was initiated in the year 2008  and 15 years have gone by. It is also a 
fact that in terms of the recommendation of the 6th CPC  in paragraph
