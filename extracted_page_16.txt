 respondents depicts that the selection process initiated by the 
respondents in the year 2008 for Followers (Group „D‟) posts need not 
be implemented.   
22. Whereas it is t he submission of Ms. Sangeeta Chandra , learned 
counsel appearing for the petitioner  that the selection process  in the 
present case  being complete with the issuance of the final merit list, any 
subsequent communication of 2009, i.e., of October 29, 2009 s hall have 
no bearing on the recruitment process which was initiated in the year 
2008 .  
23. Suffice to state that t his submission of Ms. Chandra is 
appealing inasmuch as , though a decision was taken by the Government 
to abolish Group „D‟ posts to upgrade the same with Group „C‟ posts, 
on the basis of the recommendation of the 6th CPC , which was 
implemented on September 1, 2008, the said decision is made effective 
only by framing of the new Recruitment Rules  i.e., the Rules of 2010,  
which were finally issued on August  3, 2010.  
24. Therefore, a  related question would arise as to  whether the 
recruitment process  which was initiated and culminated in terms of the 
old Rules of 2000 , need s to be scrapped / not given effect to  before the 
advent of  the new Rules of 2010 .   
25. Ms. Chandra is justified in relying upon the saving 
contemplated  under  the Rules of 2010, framed on August 3, 2010. She 
stated, the said Rules shall be in supersession of the Rules of 2000 , 
„except as respect of things done or omi tted to be done before such 
supersession ‟.   
26. In other words, it is her submission that the supersession of the
