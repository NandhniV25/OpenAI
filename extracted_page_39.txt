 7.19.45, it has been recommended that all the posts in CPMFs should 
be combatised like the position existing in t he Defence Forces and also 
the fact that all posts of „Followers ‟ / other Group D posts in CPMFs 
have been  converted into Group -C posts and be placed in PB-I with 
grade pay of ₹2000/ -. 
39. It is also a n admitted  fact that the selection process which  was 
initiated in the year 2008, was for Group -D posts, which do not  exist as 
of today,  but the same were in  existence,  when the selection process 
was initiated.  Against, the order passed by this Court dismissing the 
petition, the petitioner had approached the Supreme Court. The 
Supreme Court directed this Court to decide the issue on merit insofar 
as the plea of the petitioner  that his appointment to the post in que stion 
should be governed by the old Rules of 2000  instead of the new Rules 
of 2010 . As such, the  only relief in the facts of this case that can be 
granted to the petitioner is that he shall be given the appointment w.e.f. , 
the date of culmination of the se lection process as a „Follower ‟ i.e., 
from October 2008 . The appointment shall be made in the erstwhile 
Group -D Posts / „Followers‟ , and thereafter, he shall be given proper 
training to make him combatised . On successful completion of such 
training, he shou ld be absorbed in the grade of combatant Constable  
(Washerman) . It is clarified that t he petitioner shall not be entitled to 
any monetary benefits. His seniority and pay fixation (on notional 
basis) shall relate back to the month of October 2008.  
40. The present writ petition is disposed of in the above terms. 
There is no order as to Costs.
