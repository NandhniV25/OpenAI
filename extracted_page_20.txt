 admission in any competitive entrance examination "any seat 
reserved exclusively for Indian citizens" was an abrupt 
notifications all these notifications we re somewhat softened by 
of the retroactive application facially was that all OCI Card 
holders who had planned their academic careers based upon 
pre-existing notifications dated 11.04.2005, 05.01.2007 and 
05.01.2009 were held to be eligible to continue with  that 
privilege in terms of the judgment in Anushka (supra).  The 
relevant portions of the judgment in Anushka (supra) are

struck down. Article 14 of the Constitution can be 
invoked and contend discrimination only when persons 
similarly placed are treated differently and in that view 
the OCI Cardholders being a class by themselves 
cannot claim parity with the Indian citizens, exc ept for 
making an attempt to save the limited statutory right 
bestowed. To that extent certainly the fairness in the
