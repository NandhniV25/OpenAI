The bank argued that its rights as a financial creditor should take precedence over the Customs Act, and it should be allowed to recover dues under the SARFAESI Act. The court agreed with the bank, stating that the SARFAESI Act overrides other laws, including the Customs Act. The court quashed the communication from the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and allowed the bank to proceed with its actions against the defaulter. The court kept open the option for the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence to pursue recovery against other parties.\n"
