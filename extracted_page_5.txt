 per the fresh  Recruitment Rules of Constable ( Tradesmen) 
(Group 'C' post) which are as  under:  
“(a) not having of ITI/Experience Certificate and  
(b) Less in height by 0.5 cm (petitioner‟s height was 167  
cms against requirement of 167.5 cms as per revised 
RRs).”  
6. It was further mentioned in the said c ommunication that 
none of the  39 candidates of the Recruitment Centre of 
Headquarter, who were in the  zone of consideration as per the 
earlier eligibility criteria of Enrolled Flower  (Group 'D' post), 
were fulfilling the eligibility criteria as per the fre sh 
recruitment rules for the post in question. Accordingly, the 
complete  recruitment process was cancelled.  
7. It is also not in dispute that respondent did not issue any 
appointment  letter to petitioner and other 38 candidates till 
date.  
8. For the relief  sought in the present petition, the petitioner 
earlier  moved a writ petition, i.e. W.P.(C) 1102/2019, and the

ordinate Bench of this Court and  relevant portion of same is 
reproduced as under:  
“2. Le arned counsel for the Petitioners seeks leave to  
withdraw this petition with liberty to file a proper 
petition,  including explaining the delay in approaching 
the Court for  relief.  
3. Dismissed as withdrawn with liberty as prayed for.”  
9. It is pertinent to  mention here that the petitioner has 
challenged the  Recruitment Rules of 2010 whereas the 
petitioner was selected in the  recruitment process of 2008 and 
the ground of the petitioner is that  recruitment of 2010 cannot 
be applied on the recruitment process of 2008.  
10. It is not in dispute that the recruitment process of 2008 was 
cancelled  and none of the candidates selected from the said 
recruitment process were  given appointment.  
11. Moreover, when the petitioner earlier filed petition, i.e. 
W.P.(C)  1102/2 019, even on that date, the petition was filed 
with delay and latches as  is evident from order dated 
04.02.2019 passed by Co -ordinate Bench of this  Court. Even
