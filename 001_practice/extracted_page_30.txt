42. There is a distinction between right acquired or 
accrued, and privilege, hope and expectation to get 
a right, as rightly pointe d out by the High Court in 
the impugned judgment. A right to apply for

MANU/SC/0374/1968 : [1969]1SCR580 this Court

undertaking. It was held that a right to purchase

with respect to the same had already been initiated and a merit list 
thereof was already prepared  and as such, the recruitmen t process 
initiated under the Rules of 2000  shall not be vitiated  with the advent of 
the new rules , i.e., the Rules of 2010 .

the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in the case  of Sivanandan
