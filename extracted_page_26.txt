 Act, 1955, to confer or alter the rights as provided for 
therein. However, when a conferred right is withdrawn, 
modified or altered, the process leading thereto should 
demonstrate application of mind, nexus to the object o f 
such withdrawal or modification and any such decision 
should be free of arbitrariness. In that background, the 
impugned notification dated 04.03.2021 though 
competent Under Section 7B(1) of Act, 1955 suffers 
from the vice of non -application of mind and d espite 
being prospective, is in fact 'retroactive' taking away the 
rights which were conferred also as a matter of policy 
of the Sovereign State.  
59. Hence, the notification being sustainable 
prospectively, we hereby declare that the impugned 
portion of th e notification which provides for 
supersession of the notifications dated 11.04.2005, 
05.01.2007 and 05.01.2009 and the Clause 4(ii), its 
proviso and Explanation (1) thereto shall operate 
prospectively in respect of OCI cardholders who have 
secured the sam e subsequent to 04.03.2021.  
60. We further hold that the Petitioners in all these 
cases and all other similarly placed OCI cardholders 
will be entitled to the rights and privileges which had 
been conferred on them earlier to the notification dated 
04.03.20 21 and could be availed by them 
notwithstanding the exclusion carved out in the 
notification dated 04.03.2021. The participation of the 
Petitioners and similarly placed OCI cardholders in the 
selection process and the subsequent action based on 
the interim  orders passed herein or elsewhere shall 
stand regularised.  
 
16. It is evident that the ruling held that notification (dated 
04.03.2021) operated arbitrarily because firstly it indicated 
non-application of mind in not saving accrued rights . The 
application  of proviso to Clause 4 (ii) of the notification of 
04.03.2021 was held to have no nexus with the objects sought 
to be achieved.  The court also held that those who are born
