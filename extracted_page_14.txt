 (Tradesman Group „C‟ and Enrolled followers Group „D‟ Posts) 
Recruitment Rules, 2000 , which  have been superseded.  It follows , it is 
the Rules of 2000 which gover ns the case of the  petitioner and not the 
Rules of 2001.  It also appears, the reference to the Rules of 2001 is an

get the joining letter as he qualified the height criteria under the old 
Rules of 200 0 which were in forc e at the time when the recruitment

basis, the candidates including the petitioner who successfully qualified 
under the old Rules of 2000 .   
18. She state d that the reliance placed by the respondents on the

perusal of the judgment that the same was on specific facts of the case 
as arose for consideration in that petition.   
19. Suffice to state that Mr. D. S. Vohra , learned SPC, appearing
